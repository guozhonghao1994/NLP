prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing in our ordinary shares and ADSs discussed under Risk Factors, before deciding whether to purchase our ordinary shares or ADSs.    Our Business    We are the leading Chinese language Internet search provider. Our search
engine was the most frequently used search engine in China in 2004, according to a survey conducted by Shanghai iResearch Co., Ltd., or iResearch, a market research firm specializing in Chinas Internet industry. Our Baidu.com website was the
second largest website in China and the sixth largest website globally, as measured by user traffic that reflects page views and reach during the three-month period ended July 31, 2005, according to Alexa.com. We offer a unique Chinese language
search platform for both users and customers. Our platform consists of our websites and Baidu Union, which is our network of third-party websites.    Our services are designed to enable Internet search users to find relevant information online, including Chinese language web pages, news, images and
multimedia files, through links provided on our websites. We provide our users with easy access to an index of over 740 million web pages, 80 million images and 10 million multimedia files. We also offer a query-based online community, Baidu Post
Bar, which currently consists of over 820,000 message boards.    Our auction-based pay-for-performance, or P4P, services enable our customers to bid for priority placement of their links in keyword search results. We believe we were the first auction-based P4P service provider in China. Our online
advertising services allow customers to use both query sensitive and non-query sensitive advertising services, including text links, graphical advertisements and other forms of online advertising. We design and deliver our services to our P4P and
tailored solutions customers based on their online marketing requirements. Our P4P customers are those who primarily use our auction-based P4P services, and our tailored solutions customers are those to whom we provide marketing solutions, which may
consist of one or more forms of our online advertising services as well as P4P services. In 2004, we had over 34,600 online marketing customers.    Founded in January 2000, we launched Internet search services on our Baidu.com website and began generating revenues from P4P services in September 2001.
We began offering other online marketing services in July 2003. We have grown significantly since we commenced operations. Our total net revenues increased from RMB10.5 million in 2002 to RMB110.9 million (US$13.4 million) in 2004, representing a
compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 224.6%. In the three months ended March 31, 2005, we generated total net revenues of RMB42.6 million (US$5.2 million).   
Our Industry    The Internet search industry in China is evolving rapidly as an increasing number of people seek information, products and services via the Internet.
According to iResearch, the number of Internet search users in China is projected to grow from 115 million in 2005 to 187 million in 2007, representing a CAGR of 27.5%. With the growth of Internet usage and the rapid development of Chinas
Internet search market, online marketing has become more widely adopted. According to a 2003 report published by IDC, a leading market research firm, total online marketing revenues in China would amount to approximately US$130 million in 2004. The
paid search market is expected to be the fastest growing segment of online marketing in the Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan) through 2007.

Chinas Internet search industry presents unique challenges and opportunities. Chinese language
search engines must address the needs of Internet users in China, who generally search online for a broad variety of information, including Chinese language web pages, news, multimedia files and images. Chinese language search engines must also
develop special language processing technologies to generate relevant results due to the complexities associated with the Chinese language and Chinese keyword searches. Moreover, Chinese language search engines providing paid search services must
develop an effective distribution network to acquire customers, collect payments and provide customer service since Chinas paid search customers are largely comprised of a broad and fragmented base of small to medium-sized enterprises, or
SMEs.    Our Strengths, Strategies and Risks    We believe that our leading position in China is primarily attributable to
the following strengths:   


 

 
largest Chinese language search audience as measured by user traffic;   


 

 
first P4P service provider in China with an extensive customer base across industries;   


 



 
leading technology with a proven platform providing users with relevant search results and customers with a cost-effective way to reach potential consumers; and
  


 

 
extensive and effective nationwide network of over 200 regional distributors, providing high-quality and consistent customer services.    Our goal is to become a platform that provides Internet users with the best
way to find information and allows businesses to reach a broad base of potential customers. We intend to achieve our goal by implementing the following strategies:   


 

 
enhancing user experience and increasing traffic through the development and introduction of new search-related features and functions;   


 

 
growing our online marketing business by attracting potential customers and increasing per-customer spending on our services;   


 

 
expanding Baidu Union by leveraging our brand and offering competitive economic arrangements to Baidu Union members; and   


 

 
pursuing selective strategic acquisitions and alliances that will allow us to increase user traffic, enlarge our customer base, expand our product offerings and reduce
customer acquisition costs.    The successful
execution of our strategies is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including our ability to:   


 

 
maintain our leading position in the Internet search industry in China;
