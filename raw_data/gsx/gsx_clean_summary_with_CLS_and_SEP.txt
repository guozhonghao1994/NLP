The following summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP] In addition to this summary, we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing in the ADSs discussed under “Risk Factors,” before deciding whether to invest in the ADSs. [CLS] [SEP] This prospectus contains information from an industry report commissioned by us and prepared by Frost & Sullivan, an independent research firm, to provide information regarding our industry and our market position in China. [CLS] [SEP] We refer to this report as the “Frost & Sullivan Report. [CLS] [SEP]”  Our Mission  Make education better through technology.
We are a technology-driven education company. [CLS] [SEP] Our core expertise is in online K-12 courses, and we are the third largest online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring service provider in China in terms of gross billings in 2018, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report. [CLS] [SEP] Our K-12 courses cover all primary and secondary grades, and contributed over 73% and 79%, respectively, of our total revenues in 2018 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. [CLS] [SEP] We also offer foreign language, professional and interest courses. [CLS] [SEP] Our total enrollments increased from 79,632 in 2017 to 767,102 in 2018, and from 480,458 in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 to 1,622,862 in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. [CLS] [SEP] We adopted the online live large-class format to deliver our courses, which we believe is the most effective and scalable model to disseminate scarce high quality teaching resources to aspiring students in China. [CLS] [SEP] Driven by rapid growth and operational efficiency of our business, we achieved profitability in 2018.
We relentlessly pursue the highest quality in our course offerings. [CLS] [SEP] Our education excellence is backed by our high quality teachers and in-house curriculum development expertise. [CLS] [SEP] To create a disciplined, effective and engaging learning environment under the large-class format, we have adopted a dual-teacher system, staffing each class with an instructor and multiple tutors well trained in the relevant subjects or curriculum. [CLS] [SEP] We pride ourselves on our rigorous and systematic teacher selection and coaching process. [CLS] [SEP] As of September 30, 2019, we had 209 instructors, including 149 full-time instructors and 60 full-time exclusively contracted instructors, and 2,574 tutors. [CLS] [SEP]  We develop and tailor our proprietary curriculum specifically to our online live large-class format with the goal of driving students’ engagement and academic performance. [CLS] [SEP] We design our courses in ways to inspire students’ genuine interest and in-depth interactions, which in turn foster students’ holistic development and thus better learning results. [CLS] [SEP] With our superior education quality, our online K-12 large-class courses were priced at a significant premium compared to average online K-12 large-class courses in China in 2018, according to the Frost & Sullivan Report.
There is significant imbalance of education resources between urban and rural areas in China. [CLS] [SEP] The strong demand for high-quality education resources nationwide drives the growth of online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring market in China. [CLS] [SEP] According to the Frost & Sullivan Report, China’s online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring market in terms of gross billings grew from RMB0. [CLS] [SEP]7 billion in 2013 to RMB15. [CLS] [SEP]1 billion (US$2. [CLS] [SEP]1 billion) in 2018, representing a CAGR of 86. [CLS] [SEP]5%, and is expected to further increase to RMB202. [CLS] [SEP]0 billion (US$28. [CLS] [SEP]3 billion) in 2023, representing a CAGR of 68. [CLS] [SEP]0% from 2018. [CLS] [SEP]  The online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring market in China is still at an early development stage. [CLS] [SEP] Despite its short history, the online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring market is already more consolidated than the offline market. [CLS] [SEP] According to Frost & Sullivan, the top market players for online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring as a whole are expected to grow faster than the overall online K-12 after-school tutoring industry. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Strengths  We believe the following competitive strengths are essential for our success and differentiate us from our competitors:  leadership in China’s online K-12 large-class after-school tutoring market;  superior education quality;  robust proprietary technology infrastructure and application;  highly scalable business model with exceptional operating efficiency; and  renowned founder and seasoned management team with a corporate DNA of student service.
We intend to enhance student engagement and increase our paid course enrollment by pursuing the following strategies:  continue to enhance the quality of our education services and students’ learning experience;  attract and develop our teaching talent;  strengthen our technologies and data analytics capabilities;  expand our course offerings; and  enhance our brand recognition.
We face risks and uncertainties in realizing our business objectives and executing our strategies, including those relating to:  our limited operating history with our current business model, which makes it difficult to predict our prospects and our business and financial performance;  our ability to attract students to purchase our course packages and to increase the spending of our students;  our ability to manage our growth and execute our growth strategies effectively;  our ability to engage, train and retain high quality teaching staff;  our reliance on certain top quality instructors;  our past net loss and uncertainty over whether we can remain profitable or increase profitability in the future;  the intense competition that we face, which could divert students to our competitors, leading to pricing pressure and loss of market share, and significantly reduced net revenues;  new legislation or proposed changes in the PRC regulatory requirements regarding online private education;  the development of regulatory requirements on operating licenses and permits for our online education services in China; and  our ability to improve or maintain our sales and marketing efficiency.
See “Risk Factors” and other information included in this prospectus for a discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that we face. [CLS] [SEP]  Corporate History and Structure  We commenced operations through Beijing BaiJiaHuLian Technology Co. [CLS] [SEP], Ltd. [CLS] [SEP], or Beijing BaiJiaHuLian, in June 2014. [CLS] [SEP] Our holding company, BaiJiaHuLian Group Holdings Limited, was incorporated in August 2014 in the Cayman Islands to facilitate financing and offshore listing. [CLS] [SEP] In January 2019, we renamed our company as GSX Techedu Inc.
In August 2014, we established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Hong Kong, BaiJiaHuLian HK Holdings Limited. [CLS] [SEP] In January 2015, BaiJiaHuLian HK Holdings Limited established a wholly-owned subsidiary in China, Beijing Lexuebang Network Technology Co. [CLS] [SEP], Ltd. [CLS] [SEP], or Beijing Lexuebang.
In April 2015, we gained control over Beijing BaiJiaHuLian through Beijing Lexuebang by entering into a series of contractual arrangements with Beijing BaiJiaHuLian and its shareholders. [CLS] [SEP] The contractual arrangements with Beijing BaiJiaHuLian were subsequently amended and restated in March 2019.
On June 6, 2019, our ADSs commenced trading on the NYSE under the symbol “GSX. [CLS] [SEP]” We raised from our initial public offering and from exercising the over-allotment option by the underwriters approximately US$191. [CLS] [SEP]2 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting commissions and the offering expenses payable by us.
The following diagram illustrates our corporate structure, including our subsidiaries, our VIE and its subsidiaries, as of the date of this prospectus:         Notes: (1)  Represents 73,305,288 Class B ordinary shares held by Ebetter International Group Limited, a British Virgin Islands company ultimately owned by The Better Learner Trust, as of the date of this prospectus.

[CLS] [SEP]  Implication of Being an Emerging Growth Company, a Foreign Private Issuer and a Controlled Company  As a company with less than US$1. [CLS] [SEP]07 billion in revenue for our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act. [CLS] [SEP] An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements compared to those that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. [CLS] [SEP] These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting. [CLS] [SEP] The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. [CLS] [SEP] However, we have elected to “opt out” of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted for public companies.
This decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable. [CLS] [SEP]  We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (a) the last day of the fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of at least US$1. [CLS] [SEP]07 billion; (b) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering; (c) the date on which we have, during the preceding three-year period, issued more than US$1. [CLS] [SEP]0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of the ADSs that are held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. [CLS] [SEP] Once we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will not be entitled to the exemptions provided in the JOBS Act discussed above.
