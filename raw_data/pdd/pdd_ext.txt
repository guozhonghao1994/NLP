The following summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.<q>This prospectus contains estimates and information concerning our industry, including market position, market size and growth rates of the markets in which we participate, that are based on publicly available industry publications and reports.<q>In addition to this summary, we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing in our ADSs discussed under "Risk Factors," before deciding whether to buy our ADSs.
We are an innovative and fast-growing "new e-commerce" platform that provides buyers with value-for-money merchandise and fun and interactive shopping experiences.<q>Our Pinduoduo mobile platform offers a comprehensive selection of attractively priced merchandise, featuring a dynamic social shopping experience that leverages social networks as an effective and efficient tool for buyer acquisition and engagement.<q>Our GMV in 2017 and 2018 was RMB141.
We pioneered an innovative "team purchase" model on our platform.<q>They are encouraged to share product information on such social networks, and invite their friends, family and social contacts to form a shopping team to enjoy the more attractive prices available under the "team purchase" option.<q>Buyers can access our platform and make team purchases by either visiting our platform directly or through popular social networks, such as Weixin and QQ.
In 2018, we had 3.<q>Our large and highly active buyer base has helped attract merchants to our platform, and the scale of our sales volume has encouraged merchants to offer even more competitive prices and customized products and services to buyers, thus forming a virtuous cycle.<q>6 million active merchants on our platform, offering a broad range of product categories.
Our "team purchase" model has transformed online shopping into a dynamic social experience.<q>We have consciously built our platform to resemble a "virtual bazaar" where buyers browse and explore a full spectrum of products while interacting with one another.<q>In contrast to the conventional search-based "inventory index" model, our platform brings out the fun and excitement of discovery and shopping.
Not only is the "team purchase" model an efficient tool for user engagement and expansion, it also helps us understand our users better so that we could help improve the supply chain efficiency of the retail market.<q>We can channel user preferences based on our predictive model to merchants so that they can adjust their production, inventory planning, sales plans, and logistics services accordingly.<q>As a result, upstream suppliers can be more tightly connected and better informed of consumer demand, transformed by the "C2M" (Consumer-to-Manufacturer) model.
As a pioneer in the new e-commerce era, we leveraged our platform and developed "Internet + Agriculture" initiative to facilitate direct sales between small-scale farmers and consumers.<q>Small-scale farmers in China have traditionally relied heavily on layers of distributors to market and sell their produce to the broader consumer base, which is highly inefficient.<q>The large demand helps farmers to directly sell to consumers without going through layers of distributors, thereby improving the overall supply chain efficiency and reducing cost.
Technology and innovation are at the core of our company.<q>The strong and extensive technology background of our senior management team has led us to the forefront of the e-commerce industry.<q>We have developed our own proprietary technology infrastructure that seamlessly connects our platform with buyers and merchants and supports our business growth.
We have experienced substantial growth since our inception in 2015.<q>This business no longer generates revenues after we fully transitioned into our current marketplace model in the first quarter of 2017.<q>We currently generate revenues primarily from online marketplace services.
The total retail sales of consumer goods in China increased from RMB24.<q>3 trillion (US$3.<q>5 trillion) in 2013 to RMB36.
We believe that the following trends are driving the continued growth of China's e-commerce industry and are reshaping its future form.<q>First, mobile shopping has become the dominant form of online retail in China, as consumers increasingly use their fragmented time to browse and shop anywhere, anytime.<q>Second, the extensive logistics infrastructure and wide adoption of mobile payment have made mobile shopping increasingly efficient and convenient.
We believe that "new e-commerce" has the following key characteristics:  Spontaneous shopping.<q>Fueled by these powerful trends, a new form of e-commerce, which is referred to as "new e-commerce," is emerging.<q>Social element in shopping behavior.
In addition, China has a massive agricultural market that we are addressing.<q>According to National Bureau of Statistics, China's total agricultural GDP reached RMB6,801 billion (US$990.<q>2 billion) in 2017.
According to the latest target set by the Ministry of Agriculture of China, total e-commerce sales of agricultural goods in China is expected to reach RMB800 billion (US$116.<q>5 billion) in 2020 from RMB150 billion in 2015, representing a CAGR of 39.8%.
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors: innovative "new e-commerce" platform with rapid growth;  value-for-money merchandise with a strong focus on quality control;  highly active buyer base cultivated by a fun and interactive shopping experience;  strong commitment to technology; and  experienced management team with extensive technology and operational background.
We intend to pursue the following growth strategies: increase our buyer base and engagement;  expand merchandise choices and offerings;  enhance user trust, brand recognition and continue to adhere to strict quality control;  further improve technology and distributed artificial intelligence capability;  pursue select strategic investment and expansion opportunities; and  attract and retain talents.
