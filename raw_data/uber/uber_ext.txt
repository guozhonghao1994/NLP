This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information you should consider before investing in our common stock.<q>This summary highlights information contained elsewhere in this prospectus.<q>You should read this entire prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
We revolutionized personal mobility with Ridesharing, and we are leveraging our platform to redefine the massive meal delivery and logistics industries.<q>While we have had unparalleled growth at scale, we are just getting started: only 2% of the population in the 63 countries where we operate used our offerings in the quarter ended December 31, 2018, based on MAPCs.<q>Our mission is to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion.
The foundation of our platform is our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.<q>Our network becomes smarter with every trip.<q>Massive network.
Product expertise.<q>Operational excellence.<q>Our products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provide platform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety and trust.
Our Personal Mobility, Uber Eats, and Uber Freight platform offerings each address large, fragmented markets.
Our Personal Mobility offering includes Ridesharing and New Mobility.<q>Ridesharing refers to products that connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws,    motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis.<q>We aim to provide everyone, everywhere on our platform with access to a safe, reliable, affordable, and convenient trip within a few minutes of tapping a button.
The rapid growth and scale of our Ridesharing products, which to date have accounted for virtually all of our Personal Mobility offering, demonstrates the size of our opportunity:     Revenue derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $3.5 billion in 2016 to $9.2 billion in 2018.
Gross Bookings derived from our Ridesharing products grew from $18.8 billion in 2016 to $41.5 billion in 2018.<q>Consumers traveled approximately 26 billion miles on our platform in 2018.
Through our Personal Mobility offering, we estimate that our platform served 2% of the population in these countries based on MAPCs in the quarter ended December 31, 2018.<q>We believe that Personal Mobility represents a vast, rapidly growing, and underpenetrated market opportunity.
We believe that our Personal Mobility market share and ridesharing category position are key indicators of our progress towards our massive market opportunity.<q>Our estimates also include an estimated 4.4 trillion public transportation miles, which we allocate to regions based on their share of the population in our addressable market.<q>See the section titled “Business—Our Market Opportunity” for more information.
Our Global Ridesharing Footprint(1) Does not include any increase in our category position in the Middle East, North Africa, and Pakistan as a result of our pending acquisition of Careem.
We believe that our scale enables the average delivery time for Uber Eats to be faster than the average delivery time for our competitors.<q>We launched our Uber Eats app just over three years ago, and we believe that Uber Eats has grown to be the largest meal delivery platform in the world outside of China based on Gross Bookings.<q>In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Uber Eats provides restaurants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which we believe generates incremental demand and improves margins for restaurants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.
We believe that Uber Freight is revolutionizing the logistics industry.<q>Uber Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizing industries to create a transparent, on-demand marketplace that seamlessly connects shippers and carriers.<q>Uber Freight connects carriers with the most appropriate shipments available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.
We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings and fuel multiple virtuous cycles of growth.<q>We can rapidly launch and scale platform products and offerings by leveraging our massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise.<q>For example, Uber Eats is used by many of the same consumers who use our Ridesharing products, is built on our existing technology stack, and has grown by leveraging many of the same regional operations teams that built our Ridesharing products.
In addition, each new product or offering enables us to invest more efficiently because we share innovations and investments across our platform offerings.<q>Similarly, in cities where we already operate, we can more efficiently launch other products and offerings, such as dockless e-bikes and e-scooters, by leveraging our existing network of Drivers and consumers and regional on-the-ground operations teams.<q>Each platform offering also increases the value of our platform to platform users, enabling us to attract new platform users and to deepen engagement with existing platform users.
There were 1.5 billion Trips on our platform for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.
There were 3.9 million Drivers on our platform for the quarter ended December 31, 2018.
Drivers have earned over $78.2 billion on our platform since 2015, as well as $1.2 billion in tips since we introduced in-app tipping for Drivers in July 2017, in each case through December 31, 2018.<q>See the section titled “Summary Consolidated Financial and Operating Data—Notes about Certain Key Metrics—Core Platform Contribution Profit (Loss) and Margin” for additional information.<q>We had a 9% Core Platform Contribution Margin in 2018.
In 2018, Gross Bookings grew to $49.8 billion, up 45% from $34.4 billion in 2017.<q>Over the same period, revenue reached $11. 3 billion, up 42% from $7.9 billion in the prior year.<q>See the section titled “Summary Consolidated Financial and Operating Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information.
In March 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume substantially all of the liabilities of Careem Inc.<q>and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Careem”).<q>This acquisition advances our strategy of having a leading ridesharing category position in every major region of the world in which we operate.
The purchase price for the acquisition is approximately $3.1 billion, consisting of up to approximately $1.7 billion of our unsecured convertible notes (the “Careem Convertible Notes”) and approximately $1.4 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.<q>The acquisition of Careem’s business is subject to applicable regulatory approvals in certain of the countries in which Careem operates.<q>The transaction is expected to close in January 2020.
The ATG Investors will collectively receive a 13.8% stake in ATG on a fully diluted basis.<q>This investment will enable us to raise dedicated capital to fund our ATG business and aims to accelerate the development and commercialization of automated ridesharing services.
In connection with the investment, we have entered into a joint collaboration agreement with Toyota, DENSO, and ATG with respect to next-generation self-driving hardware and the development of self-driving vehicles leveraging technology from each of the parties (the “ATG Collaboration Agreement”), which will be effective as of the closing of the transaction.<q>Pursuant to the ATG Collaboration Agreement, ATG and Toyota will agree on development plans, and thereafter Toyota will contribute to ATG up to an aggregate of $300 million in cash over six semi-annual installments to fund the ongoing activities contemplated under the ATG Collaboration Agreement.
In April 2019, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with PayPal, Inc.<q>The sale of the shares in the private placement is subject to certain closing conditions, including the closing of this offering and certain regulatory approvals.<q>(“PayPal”), pursuant to which PayPal will purchase 11.1 million shares of our common stock from us in a private placement at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price.
The preliminary estimates for the three months ended March 31, 2019 presented below have been prepared by, and are the responsibility of, management.<q>MAPCs represent the number of unique consumers who completed a Ridesharing or New Mobility ride or received an Uber Eats meal on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter.<q>Accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.
Trips represent the number of completed consumer Ridesharing or New Mobility rides and Uber Eats meal deliveries in a given period.<q>For example, an UberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip.<q>Gross Bookings do not include tips earned by Drivers.
The expected net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. is due to increased loss from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2019 due to continued investment in our Core Platform, including increased incentive and promotion spend.
Additionally, net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc.for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was impacted by $3.2 billion of gains from the divestitures of our Russia/CIS operations and our Southeast Asia operations, as well as a $2.0 billion unrealized gain on our investment in Didi during the same period.<q>Our incentive and promotion spend varies widely from period to period and within various markets based on competitive dynamics and other factors.
The highest estimated Core Platform Contribution Margin among these countries was approximately 54%, and the lowest estimated Core Platform Contribution Margin was approximately (10)%.
Other Core Platform Adjusted Net Revenue, which primarily consists of revenue associated with our Vehicle Solutions activities, does not include excess Driver incentives or Driver referrals and is equal to GAAP Other Core Platform revenue in all periods.
The following table provides a reconciliation of our preliminary estimates of net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. to our preliminary estimates of Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2019, and reconciles actual net income attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. to actual Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018.<q>In addition to hiring our Chief Executive Officer, we have revamped our senior executive team, hiring respected leaders with extensive public and private sector experience, including our Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai, Chief Operating Officer Barney Harford, Chief Legal Officer Tony West, Chief People Officer Nikki Krishnamurthy, Chief Marketing Officer Rebecca Messina, Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Bo Young Lee, Chief Trust and Security Officer Matt Olsen, and Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer Scott Schools.<q>Our leadership team has sought to reform our culture fundamentally by improving our governance structure, strengthening our compliance program, creating and embracing new cultural norms, committing to diversity and inclusion, and rebuilding our relationships with employees, Drivers, consumers, cities, and regulators.
We have significantly improved our governance structure and are adopting policies that are similar to those adopted by leading Fortune 500 companies, and we believe these governance improvements will benefit our performance.<q>We built a seasoned, qualified board of directors with the addition of new independent directors in 2017 and 2018, including Ursula Burns, Wan Ling Martello, Ronald Sugar, and John Thain.<q>We divided the roles of Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer and appointed Dr.Sugar as independent Chairperson.
We are committed to building a best-in-class compliance program.<q>We have made tremendous progress in creating a program that is designed to prevent and detect violations of corporate policy, law, and regulations.<q>We continue to enhance our compliance and ethics program by conducting top-down risk assessments and developing policies and practices customized for our growing and evolving global business.
We strive to create a workplace that is inclusive of everyone, where every person can be authentic, and where that authenticity is celebrated as a strength.<q>We place diversity and inclusion at the core of everything we do.<q>We embrace the future with optimism, and we work towards our mission based on eight cultural norms.
We build globally, we live locally.<q>We are customer obsessed.<q>We harness the power and scale of our global operations to deeply connect with the cities, communities, drivers, and riders that we serve every day.
We celebrate differences.<q>We stand apart from the average.<q>We ensure people of diverse backgrounds feel welcome.
As a result, we are rebuilding and strengthening our relationships with regulators around the world and engaging in an ongoing, constructive dialogue.<q>For example, in Berlin and Munich, we have actively worked with regulators to introduce   eco-friendly products, such as dockless e-bikes and our all-electric vehicle product, Uber Green, to help those cities decrease air pollution, reduce urban congestion, and increase access to clean transportation options.<q>In June 2017, we launched our Driver-focused “180 Days of Change” campaign, during which we created 38 new features and improvements for Drivers, crafted specifically to address their feedback.
We expect Uber Pro to provide Drivers with the opportunity to increase their earnings, receive discounts on vehicle maintenance and gas, and receive full tuition reimbursement to complete courses toward an undergraduate degree or a non-degree certificate through Arizona State University Online.<q>In November 2018, we introduced a Driver rewards program, Uber Pro, in beta mode in eight cities in the United States.<q>We have created an “Early Tester Program” for Drivers to try features and updates before they are widely available, and we continue to prioritize and promote good Driver relations.
It is a new day at Uber.<q>Our Platform  Massive Network  We have a massive, efficient, and intelligent network consisting of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, restaurants, shippers, carriers, and dockless e-bikes and e-scooters, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure.<q>In over 700 cities around the world, our network powers movement at the touch of a button for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.
Our strategy is to create the largest network in each market so that we can have the greatest liquidity network effect, which we believe leads to a margin advantage.<q>Starting with supply to create a liquidity network effect.
Increasing scale, creating category leadership and a margin advantage.<q>We can choose to use incentives, such as promotions for Drivers and consumers, to attract platform users on both sides of our network, which can result in a negative margin until we reach sufficient scale to reduce incentives.<q>Generally, for a given geographic market, we believe that the operator with the larger network will have a higher margin than the operator with the smaller network.
Our proprietary matching and dispatching algorithms generate more than 30 million match pair predictions per minute.<q>Pricing.<q>In areas and times of high demand, we deploy dynamic pricing to help restore balance between Driver supply and consumer demand.
Payments technologies.<q>Routing technologies.<q>We use advanced routing algorithms to build a carefully optimized system capable of handling hundreds of thousands of ETA requests per second.
Our regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scale products, support Drivers, consumers, and restaurants, and build and enhance relationships with cities and regulators.<q>Regional presence, global scale.<q>Platform user support.
Safety and trust.<q>On-demand experience.<q>For example, in 2018, we launched our Safety Toolkit, which allows both Drivers and consumers to access a menu of safety features directly from the home screen of our app.
We also believe that home delivery can address a portion of the $2.0 trillion eat-in restaurant spend, as more consumers choose to have prepared meals from restaurants delivered.<q>Therefore, we estimate our TAM to be the entire $2.8 trillion consumer food services spend.<q>However, given that spend at eat-in restaurants is often tied to    the dining experience, we do not expect to address all of the eat-in spending included in our TAM.
Investing in our common stock involves numerous risks, including the risks described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus.<q>You should carefully consider these risks before making an investment.<q>The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.
To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.<q>We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.<q>We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve profitability.
We may fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous vehicle technologies and expect that our competitors will develop such technologies before us, and such technologies may fail to perform as expected, or may be inferior to those developed by our competitors.<q>These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.<q>Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we expect that they will continue to do so.
Our potential acquisition of Careem is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.
Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.<q>We may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.<q>We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.

We paid the Driver appreciation reward to qualifying Drivers on April 27, 2019.
In the United States, each qualifying Driver received a Driver appreciation reward in an amount equal to $100, $500, $1,000, $10,000, $20,000, or $40,000, based on the number of lifetime Trips completed by the qualifying Driver.
Qualifying Drivers received only one Driver appreciation reward, which was the largest Driver appreciation reward for which they were eligible.
At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5,400,000 shares of common stock, or up to 3% of the shares offered by this prospectus, for sale at the initial public offering price through a directed share program to certain qualifying Drivers in the United States.<q>To qualify for the directed share program, a Driver must meet the minimum criteria for the Driver appreciation reward.<q>The number of shares of our common stock available for sale to the general public in this offering will be reduced to the extent that such qualifying Drivers purchase such reserved shares.
In addition, unless we specifically state otherwise, the information in this prospectus assumes:     the filing of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the adoption of our amended and restated bylaws, each of which will be in effect prior to the closing of this offering;     the automatic conversion of 903.6 million shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018 into 903.6 million shares of our common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering;     the net issuance of 39.6 million shares of our common stock subject to RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2018, for which the service-based vesting condition was satisfied as of December 31, 2018 and the liquidity event-based vesting condition will be satisfied in connection with this offering, after withholding 23.2 million shares to satisfy associated estimated income tax obligations (based on the initial public offering price of $45.00 per share and an assumed 37% tax withholding rate);     the cash exercise of a warrant to purchase 150,071 shares of our Series E redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which will result in the issuance of 150,071 shares of common stock in connection with this offering;     922,655 shares of our Series G redeemable convertible preferred stock issued in February 2019 upon the exercise of a warrant that was outstanding as of December 31, 2018, which will automatically convert into 922,655 shares of common stock in connection with this offering;     90.0 million shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of $2.9 billion accrued principal and accrued and unpaid interest on our outstanding unsecured paid-in-kind (“PIK”) convertible notes due 2021 (the “2021 Convertible Notes”) and unsecured PIK convertible notes due 2022 (the “2022 Convertible Notes,” and together with the 2021 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”) outstanding as of December 31, 2018 in connection with the closing of this offering;     no exercise of outstanding stock options or settlement of outstanding RSUs subsequent to December 31, 2018; and     no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.
The summary consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017, and 2018 (except the pro forma share and pro forma net income per share information) and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2018 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus.<q>The following tables summarize our consolidated financial and operating data.<q>Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our results in any future period.
(3)  Working capital is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities.<q>(2)  The pro forma as adjusted consolidated balance sheet data gives effect to (i) the pro forma items described in footnote (1) above and (ii) the issuance and sale by us of 180.0 million shares of our common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $45.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and the use of proceeds to satisfy the withholding tax obligations described in the footnote above, and (iii) the issuance and sale by us of 11.1 million shares of our common stock in the private placement to PayPal at the initial public offering price of $45.00 per share.<q>See our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus for further details regarding our current assets and current liabilities.
MAPCs presented for an annual period are MAPCs for the fourth quarter of the year.<q>(1)  MAPCs represent the number of unique consumers who completed a Ridesharing or New Mobility ride or received an Uber Eats meal on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter.<q>MAPCs exclude the impact of our 2018 Divested Operations.
(2)  Trips represent the number of completed consumer Ridesharing or New Mobility rides and Uber Eats meal deliveries in a given period.<q>For example, an UberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip.<q>Trips exclude the impact of our 2018 Divested Operations.
Gross Bookings exclude the impact of our 2018 Divested Operations.<q>(3) Gross Bookings represent the total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls, and fees, of Ridesharing and New Mobility rides, Uber Eats meal deliveries, and amounts paid by shippers for Uber Freight shipments, in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, Driver and restaurant earnings, and Driver incentives.<q>We define Core Platform Contribution Margin as Core Platform Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of Core Platform Adjusted Net Revenue.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures  We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance.<q>In addition to revenue, net income (loss), loss from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted Net Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, which are described below, to evaluate our business.<q>Accordingly, we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management team and board of directors.
Excess Driver incentives refer to cumulative payments, including incentives but excluding Driver referrals, to a Driver that exceed the cumulative revenue that we recognize from a Driver with no future guarantee of additional revenue.<q>Further, cumulative payments to Drivers for Uber Eats deliveries historically have exceeded the cumulative delivery fees paid by consumers.<q>Driver referrals are recorded in sales and marketing expenses.
Adjusted Net Revenue has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for revenue prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The 2018 Divested Operations decreased Adjusted Net Revenue by $49 million, $55 million, and $4 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively, due to excess Driver incentives and Driver referrals for the 2018 Divested Operations being greater than revenue for the 2018 Divested Operations in each period.<q>In addition, in 2018, we incurred charges for certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserves and settlements, which were classified in contra-revenue, as these charges include payments or potential payments to or on behalf of Drivers.<q>These charges decreased revenue by $97 million in 2018.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.<q>These limitations include the following:     Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets    being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;     Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;     Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period to period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;     Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which includes interest income, foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net, gain on divestitures, unrealized gain on investments, and change in fair value of embedded derivatives; and     Adjusted EBITDA excludes legal, tax, and regulatory reserves and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.<q>The 2018 Divested Operations decreased net income (loss) attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. by $229 million, $481 million, and $127 million in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.
