Bank of America slashed its price targets for the full range of US airline stocks Monday, as it said the hit to revenue from the coronavirus will be about twice as bad as experienced after 9/11 or during the Great Recession. [CLS] [SEP] Overall, Bank of America said that full-year revenue at US airlines is expected to fall 36%, compared to a 19% drop following the 2001 terrorist attack and a 17% decline during the financial crisis. [CLS] [SEP] Bank of America said its previous cut of price targets in the sector on March 10 is already out of date due to continue drop in demand for tickets. [CLS] [SEP] The bank now has only a $5 price target for American Airlines, less than half of its current price and well off the previous $18 target. [CLS] [SEP] It cut its price target for Spirit Airlines to $8 from $30, which also put it below the current price. [CLS] [SEP] It also reduced price targets for all the other airlines, but in each of those cases, it gave a 12-month price target that is above current market price.
