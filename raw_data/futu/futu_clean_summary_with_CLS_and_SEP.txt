The following summary is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information and financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP] In addition to this summary, we urge you to read the entire prospectus carefully, especially the risks of investing in the ADSs discussed under “Risk Factors,” before deciding whether to invest in the ADSs. [CLS] [SEP] This prospectus contains information from an industry report commissioned by us and prepared by Oliver Wyman Consulting (Shanghai) Limited, or Oliver Wyman, an independent research firm, to provide information regarding our industry and our market position in Hong Kong. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Mission  We strive to redefine traditional investing with proprietary technologies and a relentless focus on user experience, providing a gateway to building the world’s leading digital financial institution. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Business  We are an advanced technology company transforming the investing experience by offering a fully digitized brokerage platform. [CLS] [SEP] Technology permeates every part of our business, allowing us to offer a redefined user experience built upon an agile, stable, scalable and secure platform. [CLS] [SEP] We primarily serve the emerging affluent Chinese population, pursuing a massive opportunity to facilitate a once-in-a-generation shift in the wealth management industry and build a digital gateway into broader financial services. [CLS] [SEP] As of December 31, 2018, we had an attractive and rapidly growing user base of 5. [CLS] [SEP]6 million, over 502,000 registered clients, defined as users who have opened trading accounts with us, and over 132,000 paying clients, defined as registered clients who have assets in their trading accounts. [CLS] [SEP] In 2018, we brokered HK$907. [CLS] [SEP]0 billion (US$115. [CLS] [SEP]8 billion) in client trades. [CLS] [SEP] According to Oliver Wyman, we ranked fourth among Hong Kong online retail brokers in terms of online brokerage revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018.
We launched our business on the premise that no one should be precluded from investing on the basis of prohibitive transaction costs or market inexperience. [CLS] [SEP] We thus designed a platform around an elegant user experience integrating clear and relevant market data, social collaboration and best-in-class trade execution, finding that by delivering our vision through a purpose-built technology infrastructure we could disrupt traditional investing conventions. [CLS] [SEP] Over the last eight years we have continuously enhanced our technology and built a comprehensive, user-oriented and cloud-based platform that is fully-licensed to conduct securities brokerage business in Hong Kong. [CLS] [SEP] This serves as a foundation from which we execute our growth strategies with an operating efficiency that allows us to offer commission rates that are approximately one-fifth of the average rate offered by the leading players in Hong Kong, according to Oliver Wyman, creating a massive barrier to entry. [CLS] [SEP] As of December 31, 2018, approximately 65% of our workforce was dedicated to research and development, reflecting the degree to which technological excellence is entrenched in every aspect of our business.
We provide investing services through our proprietary digital platform, Futu NiuNiu, a highly integrated application accessible through any mobile device, tablet or desktop. [CLS] [SEP] Our primary fee-generating services include trade execution and margin financing which allow our clients to trade securities, such as stocks, warrants, options and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, across different markets. [CLS] [SEP] We surround our trading and margin financing services and enhance our user and client experience with market data and news, research, as well as powerful analytical tools, providing our clients with a data rich foundation to simplify the investing decision-making process. [CLS] [SEP]  We broaden our reach and promote the exchange of information through NiuNiu Community, our social network services. [CLS] [SEP] In contrast to traditional investing platforms and other online brokers, we have embedded    social media tools to create a network centered around our users and provide connectivity to users, investors, companies, analysts, media and key opinion leaders. [CLS] [SEP] This fosters the free flow of information, reduces information asymmetry and supports the investing decision-making process. [CLS] [SEP] For instance, users can exchange market views, watch live broadcasts of corporate events and participate in investment education courses offered through the NiuNiu Classroom. [CLS] [SEP] Importantly, our social network serves as a powerful engagement tool where in December 2018, the average DAUs reached over 151,000. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, in December 2018, users who were active on a daily basis spent an average of 24. [CLS] [SEP]1 minutes per trading day on our Futu NiuNiu platform. [CLS] [SEP] These user activities provide invaluable user data which informs our product development and monetization efforts.
We have a young, active and rapidly expanding user and client base. [CLS] [SEP] Our clients are, on average, 35 years old and generally high earning.
China-based investors have contributed to the aforementioned market growth by deploying a significant proportion of their increasing overseas investable assets in online securities trading, especially in Hong Kong and the United States. [CLS] [SEP] Financial assets accounted for the largest allocation of overseas investment in 2018, among which stock investment reached US$262. [CLS] [SEP]0 billion, representing a CAGR of 34. [CLS] [SEP]1% from 2012 to 2018. [CLS] [SEP] Hong Kong market is particularly favored by China-based investors, because of its geographical and cultural proximity to China as well as the large number of listed Chinese companies.
As a result, China’s overseas online retail securities market represents a unique opportunity, combining the high growth of the global online securities market coupled with expanding overseas asset allocation by China-based investors. [CLS] [SEP] In 2018, the trading volume of China’s overseas online retail securities market reached US$451. [CLS] [SEP]6 billion, growing at a CAGR of 83. [CLS] [SEP]7% from 2012 to 2018. [CLS] [SEP] The market size is expected to reach nearly US$1. [CLS] [SEP]8 trillion in 2023, representing a CAGR of 31. [CLS] [SEP]6% from 2018 to 2023. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Strengths  We believe that the following competitive strengths contribute to our success and differentiate us from our competitors: premier investing experience; closed-loop, proprietary technology infrastructure; attractive user and client base; and significant operating leverage.
We intend to pursue the following strategies to further expand our business: grow and monetize our client base; broaden our core service offerings; broaden our financial services footprint; and invest in our platform.
Due to restrictions imposed by PRC laws and regulations on foreign ownership of companies that engage in internet and other related business, Shensi Beijing later entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Shenzhen Futu, which we refer to as our variable interest entity, or VIE, in this prospectus, and its shareholders. [CLS] [SEP] For more details, see “Corporate History and Structure—Contractual Arrangements with Our VIE and Its Shareholders. [CLS] [SEP]” As a result of our direct ownership in our PRC WFOEs and the variable interest entity contractual arrangements, we are regarded as the primary beneficiary of our VIE.
We treated our VIE and its subsidiary as our consolidated affiliated entities under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U. [CLS] [SEP]S. [CLS] [SEP] GAAP, and have consolidated the financial results of these entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U. [CLS] [SEP]S. [CLS] [SEP] GAAP. [CLS] [SEP]  We operate our business mainly through Futu International Hong Kong, which is a HK SFC-regulated entity that holds the relevant licenses related to our securities brokerage business. [CLS] [SEP] In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we generated revenues of HK$83. [CLS] [SEP]2 million, HK$305. [CLS] [SEP]6 million and HK$795. [CLS] [SEP]0 million (US$101.

[CLS] [SEP]8% of our total assets as of the end of the same years, respectively, taking intercompany transaction offset into consideration. [CLS] [SEP] We also conduct research and development activities in China through Futu Network and our VIE. [CLS] [SEP] In 2016, 2017 and 2018, we generated revenues of HK$2. [CLS] [SEP]5 million, HK$4. [CLS] [SEP]6 million and HK$3. [CLS] [SEP]2 million (US$0. [CLS] [SEP]4 million), accounting for 2. [CLS] [SEP]9%, 1. [CLS] [SEP]5% and 0. [CLS] [SEP]4% of our total revenues, respectively, from Futu Network and our VIE, whose assets amounted to HK$45. [CLS] [SEP]2 million, HK$73. [CLS] [SEP]8 million and HK$224. [CLS] [SEP]8 million (US$28. [CLS] [SEP]7 million), accounting for 1. [CLS] [SEP]0%, 0. [CLS] [SEP]7% and 1. [CLS] [SEP]4% of our total assets as of the end of the same years, respectively, taking intercompany transaction offset into consideration. [CLS] [SEP] As of the date of this prospectus, we have not engaged in any operating activities through our other subsidiaries in China. [CLS] [SEP]  We strategically established Futu Financial Limited, Futu Lending Limited and Futu Network Technology Limited, each a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company in Hong Kong, in April 2017, April 2017 and August 2015, respectively, for the purpose of our potential business expansion in the future. [CLS] [SEP] As of the date of this prospectus, these subsidiaries have not engaged in any active operating activities. [CLS] [SEP] In the past, compared to our total revenues and total assets, the revenues and assets of these subsidiaries were nominal.
In addition, we established Futu Inc. [CLS] [SEP], Futu Clearing Inc. [CLS] [SEP] and Moomoo Inc. [CLS] [SEP], each a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company in the United States, in December 2015, August 2018 and March 2018, respectively, in order to improve our ability to offer investing services in overseas markets. [CLS] [SEP] As of the date of this prospectus, Futu Inc.
and Moomoo Inc. [CLS] [SEP] have only recently commenced operations, and Futu Clearing Inc. [CLS] [SEP] has not yet commenced operations. [CLS] [SEP] The revenues and assets of these subsidiaries are nominal compared to the total assets of our company.

The following summary consolidated statement of comprehensive (loss)/income data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, summary consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 and summary consolidated cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP] Our consolidated financial statements are prepared and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U. [CLS] [SEP]S. [CLS] [SEP] GAAP. [CLS] [SEP] Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results expected for future periods. [CLS] [SEP] You should read this Summary Consolidated Financial and Operating Data section together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP]      Note:  (1)  Share-based compensation expenses were allocated as follows:      Summary Operating Data:             Note:  (1)  Among these users, 1,305,131, 719,812 and 1,236,885 had at least one activity on our platform in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. [CLS] [SEP] A user is deemed to have an activity on our platform if the user has accessed and logged into our Futu NiuNiu applications or websites at least once in a given period.
Non-GAAP Measures  We use adjusted net (loss)/income, a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. [CLS] [SEP] Adjusted net (loss)/income represents net (loss)/income excluding share-based compensation expenses, and such adjustment has no impacts on income tax. [CLS] [SEP]  We believe that adjusted net (loss)/income helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain expenses that we include in net income. [CLS] [SEP] We believe that adjusted net (loss)/income provides useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.
Adjusted net (loss)/income should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. [CLS] [SEP] Investors are encouraged to    review the historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. [CLS] [SEP] Adjusted net (loss)/income presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. [CLS] [SEP] Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. [CLS] [SEP] We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. [CLS] [SEP]  The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our adjusted net (loss)/income to net (loss)/income for the years indicated.
