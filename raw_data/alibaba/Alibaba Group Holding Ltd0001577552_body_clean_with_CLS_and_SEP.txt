Our mission is to make it easy to do business anywhere. [CLS] [SEP]  Our founders started our company to champion small businesses, in the belief that the Internet would level the playing field by enabling small enterprises to leverage innovation and technology to grow and compete more effectively in the domestic and global economies. [CLS] [SEP] Our decisions are guided by how they serve our mission over the long-term, not by the pursuit of short-term gains. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Business  We are the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume in 2013, according to the IDC GMV Report. [CLS] [SEP] We operate our ecosystem as a platform for third parties, and we do not engage in direct sales, compete with our merchants or hold inventory. [CLS] [SEP]
We operate Taobao Marketplace, Chinas largest online shopping destination, Tmall, Chinas largest third-party platform for brands and retailers, in each case in terms of gross merchandise volume, and Juhuasuan, Chinas most popular group buying marketplace by its monthly active users, in each case in 2013 according to iResearch. [CLS] [SEP] These three marketplaces, which comprise our China retail marketplaces, generated a combined GMV of RMB1,833 billion (US$296 billion) from 279 million active buyers and 8. [CLS] [SEP]5 million active sellers in the twelve months ended June 30, 2014. [CLS] [SEP] A significant portion of our customers have begun transacting on our mobile platform, and we are focused on capturing this opportunity. [CLS] [SEP] In the three months ended June 30, 2014, mobile GMV accounted for 32. [CLS] [SEP]8% of our GMV, up from 27. [CLS] [SEP]4% in the preceding three months and from 12. [CLS] [SEP]0% in the same period in the previous year. [CLS] [SEP] The number of mobile MAUs increased from 136 million for the month ended December 31, 2013, to 163 million for the month ended March 31, 2014 and to 188 million for the month ended June 30, 2014. [CLS] [SEP]
In addition to our three China retail marketplaces, which accounted for 81. [CLS] [SEP]6% of our revenues in fiscal year 2014, we operate Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com, Chinas largest global online wholesale marketplace in 2013 by revenue, according to iResearch, 1688. [CLS] [SEP]com, our China wholesale marketplace, and AliExpress, our global consumer marketplace, as well as provide cloud computing services. [CLS] [SEP]
As a platform, we provide the fundamental technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help businesses leverage the power of the Internet to establish an online presence and conduct commerce with consumers and businesses. [CLS] [SEP] We have been a leader in developing online marketplace standards in China. [CLS] [SEP] Given the scale we have been able to achieve, an ecosystem has developed around our platform that consists of buyers, sellers, third-party service providers, strategic alliance partners, and investee companies. [CLS] [SEP] Our platform and the role we play in connecting buyers and sellers and making it possible for them to do business anytime and anywhere is at the nexus of this ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP] Much of our effort, our time and our energy is spent on initiatives that are for the greater good of the ecosystem and the various participants in it. [CLS] [SEP] We feel a strong responsibility for the continued development of the ecosystem and we take ownership for this development. [CLS] [SEP] Accordingly, we refer to this as our ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP]  Our ecosystem has strong self-reinforcing network effects that benefit our marketplace participants, who are invested in our ecosystems growth and success. [CLS] [SEP] Through this ecosystem, we have transformed how commerce is conducted in China and built a reputation as a trusted partner for the participants in our ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP]  We have made significant investments in proprietary technologies and infrastructure in order to support our growing ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP] Our technology and infrastructure allow us to harness the substantial volume of data generated from our marketplaces and to further develop and optimize the products and services offered on our platform.

The interactions between buyers and sellers create network effects in that more merchants attract more consumers, and more consumers attract more merchants. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, our marketplaces are interconnected in that many buyers and sellers on one marketplace also participate in the activities on our other marketplaces, thereby creating a second-order network effect that further strengthens our ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP]  The chart below depicts this network effect dynamic in our ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP]
   Chinese consumers buy on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall and Juhuasuan      While browsing or searching on Taobao Marketplace, consumers see product listings from both Taobao Marketplace and Tmall      Global consumers buy on AliExpress      Global wholesalers buy on Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com     Retail sellers      Small sellers in China sell on Taobao Marketplace and AliExpress      Chinese brands sell on Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Juhuasuan and AliExpress and global brands sell on Tmall Global      Sellers source products on 1688. [CLS] [SEP]com     Wholesale sellers      Chinese wholesalers and manufacturers supply retail merchants in China on 1688. [CLS] [SEP]com and global wholesale buyers on Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com      Chinese wholesalers and manufacturers supply directly to global consumers on AliExpress      Global wholesalers and manufacturers supply global wholesale buyers on Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com     Our Market Opportunity  Our market opportunity is primarily driven by the following factors:         Our business benefits from the rising spending power of Chinese consumers. [CLS] [SEP] Chinas real consumption in 2013 was 35. [CLS] [SEP]8% of total GDP, which is a rate that is significantly lower than that of other countries, such as the United States, which had a consumption penetration rate of 67. [CLS] [SEP]1% in 2013, according to Euromonitor International. [CLS] [SEP] We believe that growth in consumption will drive higher levels of online and mobile commerce. [CLS] [SEP]
   Chinas online shopping population is relatively underpenetrated. [CLS] [SEP] According to CNNIC, China had the worlds largest Internet population with 618 million users as of December 31, 2013. [CLS] [SEP] According to CNNIC, China had 302 million online shoppers in 2013. [CLS] [SEP] We believe the number of online shoppers will increase, driven by continued growth in the number of Internet users as well as by the higher percentage of Internet users making purchases online. [CLS] [SEP]
   We believe that consumers are expanding the categories of products and services they are purchasing online, which will further increase online and mobile commerce activity. [CLS] [SEP]
   We believe that the increased usage of mobile devices will make access to the Internet even more convenient, drive higher online shopper engagement and enable new applications. [CLS] [SEP] China has the worlds largest mobile Internet user base with 500 million users as of December 31, 2013, according to CNNIC, and mobile usage is expected to increase, driven by the growing adoption of mobile devices. [CLS] [SEP]
   Chinas offline retail market faces significant challenges due to few nationwide brick and mortar retailers, an underdeveloped physical retail infrastructure, limited product selection and inconsistent product quality. [CLS] [SEP] These challenges in Chinas retail infrastructure, which we believe are particularly acute outside of tier 1 and 2 cities, are causing consumers to leapfrog the offline retail market in favor of online and mobile commerce. [CLS] [SEP]
   China has an increasingly extensive and rapidly improving logistics infrastructure consisting of nationwide, regional and local delivery services. [CLS] [SEP] We believe that the rapid development of Chinas distributed logistics infrastructure and nationwide express delivery networks has been driven in part by the growth of e-commerce and will continue to support the unique demands of consumers and merchants conducting e-commerce transactions on marketplaces. [CLS] [SEP]  Overall, online shopping, which represented 8. [CLS] [SEP]0% of total China consumption in 2013, is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 36. [CLS] [SEP]1% from 2013 to 2016, according to iResearch, as more consumers shop online and e-commerce spending per consumer increases. [CLS] [SEP]
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and are differentiating factors that set us apart from our peers. [CLS] [SEP]         Management Team with Owner Mentality and Proven Track Record. [CLS] [SEP] Our management teams clear sense of mission, long-term focus and commitment to the values that define the Alibaba culture have been central to our successful track record. [CLS] [SEP] Our management team has created and grown leading businesses organically, including Taobao Marketplace, Tmall, Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com, Alibaba Cloud Computing and Alipay. [CLS] [SEP]
   Trusted Brands. [CLS] [SEP] Alibaba, Taobao, Tmall and Alipay are well recognized and trusted brands in China. [CLS] [SEP] Due to the strength of these brands, a majority of our customers navigate directly to our China retail marketplaces to find the products and services they are seeking instead of via third-party search engines. [CLS] [SEP]
   Thriving Ecosystem with Powerful Network Effects. [CLS] [SEP] We are the steward of a thriving ecosystem, which provides us with the following key advantages:         participants in our ecosystem are invested in its success and growth;         interactions among participants create value for one another as our ecosystem expands and generates strong network effects; and         the scope of our ecosystem and the network effects it creates, including the significant buyer traffic generated by our Taobao Marketplace, provide low-cost organic traffic for our other marketplaces and services and significantly reduce our reliance on a sales force for our marketing services. [CLS] [SEP]         Mobile Leadership. [CLS] [SEP] We are the leader in mobile commerce in China in terms of mobile retail GMV, with mobile GMV transacted on our China retail marketplaces accounting for 86. [CLS] [SEP]1% of total mobile retail GMV in China in the three months ended June 30, 2014, according to iResearch. [CLS] [SEP] Our Mobile Taobao App has been the most popular mobile commerce app in China by mobile MAUs every month since August 2012, according to iResearch. [CLS] [SEP] We had 188 million mobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces in June 2014. [CLS] [SEP]         Scalable Logistics Platform. [CLS] [SEP] We offer sellers on our marketplaces the benefits of a distributed and scalable logistics platform and information system to provide high quality delivery services to sellers and buyers on a large scale. [CLS] [SEP] Our platform approach helps to address the requirements of facilitating the delivery of packages across a wide range of product categories from millions of sellers to millions of buyers in dispersed locations across China. [CLS] [SEP] The scalability of this network was demonstrated by its success in the handling of 156 million packages generated on our Singles Day promotion in 2013 compared to a daily average of 16. [CLS] [SEP]6 million packages generated from transactions on our China retail marketplaces in the twelve months ended June 30, 2014. [CLS] [SEP]         Reliable, Scalable and Cost-effective Proprietary Technology. [CLS] [SEP] We have developed proprietary technology that is reliable, scalable and cost-effective. [CLS] [SEP] Our technology is designed to handle the large volume of transactions on our marketplaces. [CLS] [SEP] For example, we successfully processed 254 million orders within 24 hours during our Singles Day promotion on November 11, 2013. [CLS] [SEP]
   Data Insights. [CLS] [SEP] Data from consumer behavior and transactions completed on our marketplaces and interactions among participants in our ecosystem provide us with valuable insights to help us and our sellers improve the buyer experience, operate more efficiently and create innovative products and services. [CLS] [SEP]         Third-party Platform Business Model. [CLS] [SEP] Our exclusively third-party platform business model allows us to scale rapidly without the risks and capital requirements of sourcing, merchandising and holding inventory borne by direct sales companies. [CLS] [SEP] This business model drives our profitability and strong cash flow, which give us the flexibility to further invest in and improve our platform, expand our ecosystem and aggressively invest in people, technology, innovative products and strategically important assets. [CLS] [SEP]  Our Strategies  The key elements of our strategy to grow our business include:         Increase Active Buyers and Wallet Share. [CLS] [SEP] In the twelve months ended June 30, 2014, the average active buyer on our China retail marketplaces placed 52 orders, up from 45 orders in the same period in 2013 and 35 orders in the same period in 2012. [CLS] [SEP] We will continue to develop and market the value proposition of our retail marketplaces to attract new buyers as well as to increase the wallet share of existing buyers through more frequent buying and buying across more product categories. [CLS] [SEP] We intend to achieve growth through customer loyalty programs, high quality customer service, marketing and promotional campaigns, and expansion of marketing affiliates, as well as by promoting the usage of our various mobile commerce apps such as our Mobile Taobao App. [CLS] [SEP]
   Expand Categories and Offerings. [CLS] [SEP] We aim to enhance the shopping experience for consumers, increase consumer engagement and create additional opportunities for merchants by developing and promoting additional categories and offerings. [CLS] [SEP] We believe that growth in the number of product and service categories and products and services purchased within each category contributes to higher average spending per customer and increases GMV. [CLS] [SEP]
   Extend Our Mobile Leadership. [CLS] [SEP] We intend to build upon our strength in mobile commerce to develop a broader spectrum of consumer offerings, such as location-based services, O2O services and digital content, in order to fulfill our vision of becoming central to the everyday lives of our customers. [CLS] [SEP] We will also continue to look for ways to increase our mobile user base and engagement through strategic alliances, investments and acquisitions, such as our acquisition of UCWeb. [CLS] [SEP]         Enhance the Success of Sellers on a Broad Basis. [CLS] [SEP] We aim to increase the success of a broad base of sellers on our marketplaces by increasing their exposure to relevant buyer demand and providing them with more tools such as data science applications to manage their relationships with customers. [CLS] [SEP]         Enhance Data and Cloud Computing Technologies. [CLS] [SEP] We will continue to implement our data strategy through the application of data intelligence and deep learning technologies to several fields, including marketplace design, user interface, search, targeted marketing, logistics, location-based services and financial services, among others. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, we will continue to invest heavily in our cloud computing platform to support our own businesses and those of third parties. [CLS] [SEP]         Develop Cross-border Commerce Opportunities. [CLS] [SEP] Our international strategy is focused on leveraging cross-border linkages to our ecosystem that enable foreign brands and merchants to access the Chinese consumer markets without significant capital investments while providing Chinese manufacturers and merchants with a platform to reach businesses and consumers across the world. [CLS] [SEP] For example, we will continue to grow our international business by connecting overseas branded retailers to Chinese consumers (Tmall Global) and connecting Chinese suppliers to international retail markets (AliExpress) and international wholesale markets (Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com). [CLS] [SEP]
Since our founders first gathered in Jack Mas apartment in 1999, they and our management have acted in the spirit of partnership. [CLS] [SEP] We view our culture as fundamental to our success and our ability to serve our customers, develop our employees and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. [CLS] [SEP] In July 2010, in order to preserve this spirit of partnership and to ensure the sustainability of our mission, vision and values, we decided to formalize this partnership as Lakeside Partners, named after the Lakeside Gardens residential community where Jack and our other founders started our company. [CLS] [SEP] We refer to the partnership as the Alibaba Partnership. [CLS] [SEP]
We believe that our partnership approach has helped us to better manage our business, with the peer nature of the partnership enabling senior managers to collaborate and override bureaucracy and hierarchy. [CLS] [SEP] The Alibaba Partnership currently has 30 members comprised of 24 members of our management, five members of management of Small and Micro Financial Services Company and one member of management of China Smart Logistics. [CLS] [SEP] Two partners who are members of our management are also members of management of Small and Micro Financial Services Company. [CLS] [SEP] The partnership operates under principles, policies and procedures that have evolved with our business and are described below. [CLS] [SEP]  Our partnership is a dynamic body that rejuvenates itself through admission of new partners each year, which we believe enhances our excellence, innovation and sustainability. [CLS] [SEP] Unlike dual-class ownership structures that employ a high-vote class of shares to concentrate control in a few founders, our approach is designed to embody the vision of a large group of management partners. [CLS] [SEP] This structure is our solution for preserving the culture shaped by our founders while at the same time accounting for the fact that founders will inevitably retire from the company. [CLS] [SEP]
   New partners are elected annually after a nomination process based on a number of criteria including not less than five years of tenure with Alibaba Group, one of our affiliates and/or certain companies with which we have a significant relationship such as Small and Micro Financial Services Company, and require a 75% approval of all of the partners. [CLS] [SEP] Partnership votes are made on a one-partner-one-vote basis. [CLS] [SEP]
   Partners are evangelists for our mission, vision and values, both within our organization and externally to customers, business partners and other participants in our ecosystem. [CLS] [SEP]
   We require each partner to maintain a meaningful level of equity interests in our company during such individuals tenure as a partner. [CLS] [SEP]
We also face other challenges, risks and uncertainties that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. [CLS] [SEP] You should consider the risks discussed in Risk Factors and elsewhere in this prospectus before investing in our ADSs. [CLS] [SEP]
We have a demonstrated track record of successful organic business creation since our founding in 1999. [CLS] [SEP]
   In 1999, we founded Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com and Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com. [CLS] [SEP]cn, the predecessor of 1688. [CLS] [SEP]com. [CLS] [SEP]         In 2003, we launched Taobao Marketplace. [CLS] [SEP]         In 2004, we established Alipay to address the issue of trust between buyers and sellers online. [CLS] [SEP] We have continued to offer payment and escrow services on our marketplaces through Alipay following divestment of our interest in and control over Alipay in 2011. [CLS] [SEP] This divestment resulted from our managements response to regulations issued in June 2010 by the Peoples Bank of China, or the PBOC, that required non-bank payment companies to obtain a payment business license before September 1, 2011. [CLS] [SEP] These regulations provided specific guidelines for license applications only for domestic PRC-owned entities but stated that specific guidelines applicable to license applications for foreign-invested payment entities would be issued separately (although no such guidelines have been issued as of the date of this prospectus). [CLS] [SEP] Accordingly, our management restructured the ownership and control of Alipay into a company wholly-owned by PRC nationals in order to obtain a payment business license within the time period prescribed by the PBOC regulations. [CLS] [SEP] In August 2014, we entered into a share and asset purchase agreement, or the 2014 SAPA, with Small and Micro Financial Services Company and the other parties to the 2011 restructuring, pursuant to which we further restructured the contractual arrangements between us and Small and Micro Financial Services Company. [CLS] [SEP]
   In 2007, we launched Alimama, our online marketing technology platform. [CLS] [SEP]         In 2008, we launched Tmall to address an increasing consumer need for branded products and a premium shopping experience. [CLS] [SEP]         In 2009, we established Alibaba Cloud Computing to handle the increasing data management needs on our platform. [CLS] [SEP]         In 2010, we launched the Mobile Taobao App. [CLS] [SEP]  Alibaba Group Holding Limited is a Cayman Islands holding company established on June 28, 1999, and we conduct our business in China through our subsidiaries and variable interest entities. [CLS] [SEP]
Due to PRC legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, value-added telecommunications services, which include Internet content providers, or ICPs, we, similar to all other entities with foreign-incorporated holding company structures operating in our industry in China, operate our Internet businesses and other businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through      wholly-foreign owned enterprises, majority-owned entities and variable interest entities. [CLS] [SEP] The relevant variable interest entities, which are 100% owned by PRC citizens or by PRC entities owned by PRC citizens, hold the ICP licenses and operate the various websites for our Internet businesses. [CLS] [SEP] Specifically, our material variable interest entities are majority-owned by Jack Ma, our lead founder, executive chairman and one of our principal shareholders, and minority-owned by Simon Xie, one of our founders and a vice president on our China investment team where he works on projects related to our China acquisition and investment activities. [CLS] [SEP] These contractual arrangements collectively enable us to exercise effective control over, and realize substantially all of the economic risks and benefits arising from, the variable interest entities. [CLS] [SEP] See Our History and Corporate Structure  Contractual Arrangements among Our Wholly-foreign Owned Enterprises, Variable Interest Entities and the Variable Interest Entity Equity Holders. [CLS] [SEP] The contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership. [CLS] [SEP] See Risk Factors  Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure. [CLS] [SEP]  As a result, we include the financial results of each of the variable interest entities in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U. [CLS] [SEP]S. [CLS] [SEP] GAAP, as if they were our wholly-owned subsidiaries. [CLS] [SEP]
Other than the ICP licenses and other licenses and approvals for businesses in which foreign ownership is restricted or prohibited held by our variable interest entities, we hold our material assets in, and conduct our material operations through, our wholly-foreign owned and majority foreign owned enterprises, which primarily provide technology and other services to our customers. [CLS] [SEP]
We conduct our business operations across approximately 290 subsidiaries and other consolidated entities. [CLS] [SEP] The chart below summarizes our corporate legal structure and identifies our significant subsidiaries as that term is defined under Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act, as well as our variable interest entities that are material to our business, and the number of their respective subsidiaries, as of the date of this prospectus:        (1)  Includes approximately 70 subsidiaries and consolidated entities incorporated in China and approximately 120 subsidiaries incorporated in other jurisdictions that are not illustrated in this chart. [CLS] [SEP] In addition, the entities pictured in this chart hold, directly and indirectly,      an aggregate of approximately 40 additional subsidiaries and consolidated entities incorporated in China and approximately 40 additional subsidiaries incorporated outside of China not pictured in the chart.

[CLS] [SEP] Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U. [CLS] [SEP]S. [CLS] [SEP] GAAP. [CLS] [SEP]
The summary consolidated statements of operations data for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2014 and the summary consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2014 have been derived from our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP] The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of our financial position and operating results for the periods presented. [CLS] [SEP]
The following summary consolidated financial data for the periods and as of the dates indicated are qualified by reference to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, both of which are included elsewhere in this prospectus. [CLS] [SEP]
 Our historical results for any prior period do not necessarily indicate our results to be expected for any future period. [CLS] [SEP]
Summary Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:        (1) In fiscal year 2014, these expenses included an equity-settled donation expense of RMB1,269 million (US$205 million) relating to the grant of options to purchase 50,000,000 of our ordinary shares to a non-profit organization designated by Jack Ma and Joe Tsai. [CLS] [SEP]
(2) We entered into the Technology and Intellectual Property Licensing Agreement with Yahoo, or the Yahoo TIPLA, in October 2005, pursuant to which we pay royalty fees to Yahoo. [CLS] [SEP] We and Yahoo amended the existing TIPLA in September 2012, pursuant to which we made a lump sum payment in the amount of US$550 million. [CLS] [SEP]
(3) Pro forma earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders is calculated as if our convertible preference shares had been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period, or when the convertible preference shares were issued, if later. [CLS] [SEP]
(4) See  Non-GAAP Measures below. [CLS] [SEP]
(5) For the three months ended June 30, 2014, includes a net gain of RMB6,251 million (US$1,008 million) from step-up acquisitions arising from revaluations of previously held equity interest. [CLS] [SEP] See note 4 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2014. [CLS] [SEP]  Non-GAAP Measures  We use adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow, each a non-GAAP financial measure, in evaluating our operating results and for financial and operational decision-making purposes. [CLS] [SEP]  We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses that we include in income from operations and net income. [CLS] [SEP] We believe that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income provide useful information about our operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. [CLS] [SEP]
We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet. [CLS] [SEP] We use free cash flow to manage our business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance and allocate resources. [CLS] [SEP] A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a reporting period. [CLS] [SEP]  Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to net income, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. [CLS] [SEP] Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. [CLS] [SEP] Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data. [CLS] [SEP]
Adjusted EBITDA represents income from operations (which excludes interest and investment income (loss), net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity investees) before (i) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization, depreciation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets as well as (ii) one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment and an equity-settled donation expense that we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the period presented. [CLS] [SEP]
Adjusted net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets and investments, gain (loss) on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, and one-time expense items consisting of the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment, as well as an equity-settled donation expense. [CLS] [SEP]
Free cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights for, and construction of, our office campuses in China) and intangible assets, adjusted for changes in loan receivables relating to micro loans of our SME loan business and the Yahoo TIPLA amendment payment. [CLS] [SEP] We present the adjustment for changes in loan receivables because such receivables are reflected under cash flow from operating activities, whereas the secured borrowings and other bank borrowings used to finance them are reflected under cash flows from financing activities, and accordingly, the adjustment is made to show cash flows from operating activities net of the effect of changes in loan receivables. [CLS] [SEP]
The table below sets forth a reconciliation of our income from operations to adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated:     The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net income to adjusted net income for the periods indicated:       (1) Including a net gain of RMB6,251 million (US$1,008 million) from step-up acquisitions arising from revaluations of previously held equity interest. [CLS] [SEP] See note 4 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 30, 2014. [CLS] [SEP]
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods indicated:     Summary Consolidated Balance Sheet Data        (1) Reflects the automatic conversion of all of our convertible preference shares into 91,243,312 ordinary shares concurrently with the completion of this offering. [CLS] [SEP]
(2) Reflects (i) the automatic conversion of all of our convertible preference shares into 91,243,312 ordinary shares concurrently with the completion of this offering and (ii) the sale of 123,076,931 ordinary shares in the form of ADSs by us in this offering at an initial public offering price of US$68. [CLS] [SEP]00 per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. [CLS] [SEP]

(4) Includes both current and non-current investment securities and investment in equity investees. [CLS] [SEP]
(5) The decrease from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013 was primarily due to the repurchase of our ordinary shares from Yahoo in September 2012 and the privatization of Alibaba. [CLS] [SEP]com, partially offset by the issuance of ordinary shares to finance the repurchase.
